##PDX Bike to Transit Map 
:bike:  :bus:  :globe_with_meridians:

_Now with live bus positions!_ These are indicated by the arrows. Refresh them with the refresh button, and you can turn them off if you don't like them as "TriMet vehicles" in the layer switcher. Includes delay information.

This handy map can display bike routes, transit stops, and transit routes at the same time, so you can find your own way to bike to transit stops. I built it with MapBox, TileMill, CartoDB, and Leaflet (with the Leaflet Vector Layers plugin), and used OpenStreetMap and TriMet data.

Zoom in to see transit stops, and click on them for more information and a link to the TriMet TransitTracker arrival information for that stop.

This is v3 of a project I started a couple of years ago--the original version was awarded "Most Original App" in the second round of Portland's CivicApps contest.

This v3 redux was also inspired/built up from my PDX bike map. If you visit its repo (https://github.com/pdxmele/PDX-bike-map-public), you can read all about how to create one of your own.

If you like this, you might also like another project I worked on, TriMet's multimodal Map Trip Planner at http://ride.trimet.org, which can plan biking and bike-to-transit trips. Visit my website, http://pdxmele.com, for more maps and projects. 

Detailed data source info: OpenStreetMap contributors (bike routes downloaded on December 7, 2013 and styled by yours truly, basemap styled by MapBox), transit data from TriMet on December 7, 2013. Transit updates for service changes are provided as new data becomes available (and I find the time).
